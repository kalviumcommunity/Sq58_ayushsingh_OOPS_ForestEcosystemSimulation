Forest Ecosystem Simulation
•	Title: Forest Ecosystem Simulation
•	Project Description: Create a simulation of a forest ecosystem where different species of plants and animals interact with each other and their environment. The project will simulate food chains, growth cycles, and environmental changes.
•	Features:
o	Species interactions (predator-prey relationships).
o	Seasonal changes affecting the ecosystem.
o	Plant growth and decay cycles.
o	Random events like fires or droughts.
•	Programming Language: CPP
•	OOP Concepts:
o	Classes: Animal, Plant, Environment, Season.
o	Objects: Specific animals (e.g., Deer, Wolf), plants (e.g., Tree, Shrub).
o	This Pointer: Used to manage individual attributes of animals and plants.
o	Encapsulation: Animal health, plant growth rate, etc.
o	Inheritance: Different animals inherit from a base Animal class.
o	Polymorphism: Different species have different behaviors (e.g., hunting, grazing).
o	Abstraction: Simplifying the complex interactions in an ecosystem into manageable code.
